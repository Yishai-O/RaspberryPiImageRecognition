# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking the camera up to the Raspberry Pi, and getting the camera and image recognition to work. The first step was downloading Raspian, the typical Raspberry Pi's software, onto the SD card, which I then plugged into the Raspberry Pi. Next, I had to plug the Raspberry Pi into a power source and connect the camera, which were both pretty quick to do. I then had to write the code for the camera to take a picture, as well as the code for image reognition, which I was able to get from github. After that, making the camera's image and image recognition only required a few tweaks to the code, and they then worked and I was able to take a picture and run image recognition on it.
